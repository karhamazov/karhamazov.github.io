<h3>Wife Beating in Islam: Allowed or Not? 11/02/2017</h3>

<p>When Punjab govt. passed a law criminalizing all sorts of domestic violence against women, more than 30 religious groups protested against it and asked for the withdrawal of the law. The Council of Islamic Ideology, an advisory board to provide suggestions on Islamic matters, declared the law as “un-Islamic” and also demanded the removal. Jamiat Ulema Islam Chief, Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that the law would destroy home affairs by making the family matters public. He ridiculed the bill and went on to say that the lawmakers should forward a bill to “protect the rights of husbands” in Pakistan. One religious leader even asked the govt. to trial the bill’s lawmakers under article 6, which deals with “high treason”.</p>
<p>So one may get confused and ask a question: Does the Quran really allow wife beating? Many religious Mullahs in Pakistan say that the Quran order husbands to beat their wives if they disobey and support their argument by quoting the following verse:</p>
<p>“…As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) beat them…” The Quran 4:34</p>
<p>The Arabic word used in the verse above is &#8220;<em>idribuhunna</em>&#8220;, which is derived from &#8220;<em>daraba</em>&#8221; which means &#8220;<em>to beat</em>&#8220;. However, “to beat” is not the only translation of the Arabic word &#8220;<em>daraba</em>&#8220;. It is used in many other places in the Quran with different meanings. Many Islamic scholars believe that “to beat” is the wrong interpretation of the word &#8220;<em>idribuhunna</em>&#8221; in the above verse. According to them, “<em>darb</em>” does not necessarily mean to beat; if that was the case, we would have seen so many ahadith of the sahabah having done that. But they didn’t do that; in fact, if you look closely at the ahadith, they used a ‘SIWAK’ to tap their wives to draw attention when they were not listening. That is how companions of the holy prophet understood the word ‘Daraba’. You surely cannot use Siwak, a small wooden stick to clean the teeth, to beat someone. Many renowned Islamic scholars believe that bashing is completely ‘HARAM’ in Islam, and a marriage can be nullified if it has been proven that a man has beaten his wife. If wife beating was permissible, why then it would be allowed to nullify a marriage. In many other verses, Quran prohibits any kind of wife beating. Why would Quran prohibit husbands to beat their wives if at another place, it allows beating?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Do not retain them (i.e., your wives) to harm them&#8230;” (The Quran, 2:231)</p>
