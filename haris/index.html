<h2>My Essays on Feminism:</h2>

<h3>1) Beauty Discrimination</h3>
</center>
<p>I went to LUMS annual career fair today where different companies have sent their HR teams to guide students about their recruitment process. I couldn’t help but notice that most of the HR teams comprised of attractive women. I thought about it for a minute and decided to gather some more information about it. Unsurprisingly, I found out that 70% of the HR profession is dominated by women. At first, I thought of it as some gender discrimination against men but later changed my view after much pondering. Apparently, most companies hire beautiful and attractive women to attract more recruits or to sell more of their products. I was shocked to know that women in this society are forced to look pretty for a job while men are judged on their abilities.</p>

<p>On further research, I discovered that it has become a general trend and no longer restricted to HR. A survey conducted by Girls’ Attitudes Survey said that 87% of girls in UK think women are judged on appearance, not ability. They believe women are treated on different standards to their male counterpart and are highly scrutinized on their appearance rather than ability. A study at NYU suggested that women’s weight gain results in a decrease in both their income level and job prestige; on the contrary, men experience no such negative effects. A similar study at Harvard found that women wearing more makeup are judged to be more skilled than those wearing no makeup.</p>

<p>It is sad enough to see how patriarchal system restricts women to roam freely in our society but if they do manage to show some courage and step out of “char dawari”, they are arbitrated on their beauty and attractiveness.</p>
